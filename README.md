# Notes about Repository

This was put together in my spare time over the course of about a week. While the point was to show that Instruments can help you can fix any code, no matter how poorly written, there are defintely mistakes in the codebase. Please be aware that due to the fact that we're not handling concurrency correctly with Core Data, the app may randomly crash. I suggest waiting a few seconds after the app launches before interacting with it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

# Nashville CocoaHeads Coding Challenge

_April 2018_

This month we discussed performance tuning. Performance tuning can help make your app faster, perserve battery life, and generally improve a user's experience with your app.

The challenge this month is to update the Meteorite Mania graphs tab to be faster.

### Challenge 1

Make the graphs tab load the graphs faster. 

Hint: Instead of guessing why it's slow, you should use Instruments to point you to the problem areas.

### Challenge 2 (Bonus!)

Make more graphs and/or make the graphs prettier while maintaining a high level of performance.
